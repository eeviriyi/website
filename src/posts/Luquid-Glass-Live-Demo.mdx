# Liquid Glass Live Demo

> Liquid Glass is a neumorphic graphical user interface and design language developed by Apple as a unified visual theme across its suite of operating systems. It was first announced on June 9, 2025, at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). Liquid Glass features a more fluid and glass-like interface introduced in iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe, tvOS 26, and watchOS 26.
