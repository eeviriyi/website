# Build An OKLCH Color Palette

Tired of dull, inconsistent color schemes? It’s time to move beyond sRGB and explore OKLCH! This modern, perceptual color space is a game-changer for design systems because it separates Lightness (L), Chroma (C), and Hue (H) in a way that truly matches human perception. This makes creating harmonious and accessible palettes much simpler.

## Lightness: The Sigmoid Function Approach

The first step in a great palette is controlling its lightness ramp. Instead of a boring linear progression, we use a Sigmoid Function to map the lightness values.

Lightness=f(step)

This S-shaped curve is key. It allows the lightness to change slowly in the extreme light and dark ends (the tails of the S-curve) and more rapidly in the middle. This non-linear transition ensures that all the colors in your palette—from the lightest pastel to the darkest shadow—are visually distinct and evenly distributed, resulting in a more sophisticated and useful scale.

<SigmoidFunction 
  width={600} 
  height={300} 
  leftInitial={0.95} 
  rightInitial={0.38} 
/>

## Chroma: The Gaussian Curve Strategy

While a consistent hue is often desired, a flat chroma (colorfulness) across all lightness steps looks unnatural. A common design practice is to have colors be most vibrant in the middle of the lightness range and less saturated (lower chroma) at the very light and very dark ends.

We achieve this with a Gaussian Curve (or "bell curve").

Chroma=g(Lightness)
By setting the peak of the curve near the mid-point of the lightness scale (e.g., L=0.5), we ensure that highly saturated colors are reserved for the middle shades. The resulting palette feels vibrant where it should be and avoids the muddy or washed-out look that happens when high chroma is applied to extremely dark or light colors.

<GaussianCurve 
  width={600} 
  height={300} 
  lightness={0.5} 
  hue={150} 
  percentage={0.8} 
  minChroma={0.1}

## OKLCH Color Palette Generator

By combining the perceptual accuracy of the OKLCH color space with the mathematical elegance of the Sigmoid and Gaussian functions, we can generate a perfectly balanced color palette. You simply set your desired Hue (H), and the generator handles the complex, perceptual work of creating a nine-step scale that is visually smooth and consistently vibrant.
